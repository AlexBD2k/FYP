Refactorization of an EEG data analysis pipeline associated with stroke patients and implementation of a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

The objective of this project is to incorporate previous improvements made to an EEG data pipeline, refactor it,
and utilise an ROC curve model to test the accuracy of classifiers used for processing the data.

Steps taken so far:
* Set up an anaconda environment and Jupyter notebook for the project
* Ran some examples to test sklearn pakages and understand how data is processed
* Imported the original pipeline into the jupyter notebook environment
* Incorporated pipeline improvements into the Jupyter notebook
* Debugged errors within the pipeline
* Ensure all possible data points for VPA tasks are being preprocessed correctly

To-Do:
* Get classifiers to handle the corrected csv files
* Create an ROC curve model and test it on the VPA data
