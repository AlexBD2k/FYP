Analysis of EEG data associated with stroke patients and implementation of a receiver operating characteristic curve

The objective of this project is to incorporate previous improvements made to the pipeline 
and utilise an ROC curve model to test the accuracy of classifiers used for processing the data

Steps taken so far:
* Set up an anaconda environment and Jupyter notebook for the project
* Ran some examples to test sklearn pakages and understand how data is processed
* Imported the original pipeline into the jupyter notebook environment
* Incorporated pipeline improvements into the Jupyter notebook

To-Do:
* Create an Roc curve model and test it on one task type
* Ensure all data points are being preprocessed
* Incorporate more task types into the ROC curve model
